          <p>Hello! My name’s Garrett Haynes and I’m obsessed with technology. At the age of 12, I began programming games as a hobby. This hobby blossomed
into an award-winning passion. Interactive media is at the heart of my interests.</p>

<p>In high school, I won a 24 hour programming jam for a game I solo developed called QWERTY. Only a few months later I placed second at a game jam hosted by my local community. I also began <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QdG3gEgAowSyI9ZRwSwbQ">a YouTube channel</a> around this time which would go on to accrue millions of views. My most popular video was even featured by mainstream gaming outlets <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/see-a-city-of-200000-swept-away-by-sewage-in-cities-skylines/">such as PC Gamer</a> and Kotaku.</p>

<p>In college, I expanded my palette of skills to encompass web development and graphics programming. I taught myself graphics
and shader programming to build <a href="/2023/08/22/ultalights2d.html">an advanced 2D lighting engine</a> for use in
future projects. For my degree’s capstone class, I was heavily involved in the full-stack development of 
<a href="/2023/08/22/capstone.html">a custom WordPress theme.</a></p>

<p>I’m constantly learning and building new and interesting things.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in working with me, consider reaching out to:
