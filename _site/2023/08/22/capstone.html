<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>For the Spring 2023 web development and digital media capstone class, we were tasked with building a full website which represented the
department. How we went about doing so was entirely up to the class. Ultimately, we decided to build a custom WordPress theme which we could
use to integrate our novel designs and functionality.</p>

<h3 id="my-role">My Role</h3>

<p>I took an active role in almost every aspect of the project. I tried to push my skillset as far as I could to create an excellent final product.
Although I spent most of my time deep diving into the diverse WordPress technologies and APIs, I also helped to communicate, coordinate, and make decisions on fundamental aspects of the site. In the end, I produced most of the back-end used by the site, but also made many tweaks to front-end.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This project not only gave me experience as a full-stack developer, but also with the challenges of coordinating and working with a diverse team of people, each with their own skillset.</p>

<p>It’s now up to the department and future capstone classes to determine how to host, maintain, and update the site.</p>
