<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This is a 2D fully dynamic real-time lighting engine I built that’s capable of rendering shadows with penumbras. Colors are mixed together in high-dynamic range, and the results are tone-mapped via an ACES filmic tonemapping curve. The result is a colorful and suprisingly accurate light and shadow renderer. The best part is that it’s <em>very</em> fast. The scene above runs at thousands of frames per second on my machine, and it’s targeted to support typical consumer-grade laptops.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>The shadow system is based off of <a href="https://slembcke.github.io/SuperFastSoftShadows">Slembcke’s lighting system</a>. I reverse-engineered his WebGL implementation for use in Game Maker: Studio 2, which is my preferred game engine. I fixed an issue his version has with shadow geometry clipping, added <a href="https://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html">blue noise dithering</a> for smoother gradients, and HDR tone-mapping. All of this took well over a year of development (2022-2023), and I’d like to refine it even further for potential commercial use.</p>
