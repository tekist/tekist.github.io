<p>“Airwaves” was the result of toying with volume shaders in Blender for a week. A few noise maps of different sizes are added together, then combined with a sine wave in an exponent to create this shape. The noise retains the same detail regardless of the shape/size of the volume itself. Light can scatter through the volume 14 times per sample per pixel, and there are 6000 samples in total, meaning there are ~174 billion samples contained in this image. Post-processing was done via GIMP. I learned many things about shaders, volumes, and path-tracing while making this.</p>

<p>Rendering in graphics can be intensive. Volume rendering is particularly intensive. The total rendering time was about five and a half hours on an RTX 3080ti.</p>

<p>I also have some alternative renders created at the same time. Note these aren’t as “clean” as the one above due to less time spent rendering.</p>
