title: About Me
---

Hello! My name's Garrett Haynes and I'm obsessed with technology. At the age of 12, I began programming games as a hobby. This hobby blossomed
into an award-winning passion. Interactive media is at the heart of my interests.

In high school, I won a 24 hour programming jam for a game I solo developed called QWERTY. That same year, I placed second at a JCCC game jam. I also began [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QdG3gEgAowSyI9ZRwSwbQ) around this time which would go on to accrue millions of views. My most popular video was even featured by mainstream gaming outlets [such as PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/see-a-city-of-200000-swept-away-by-sewage-in-cities-skylines/) and Kotaku.

In college, I expanded my palette of skills to encompass web development and graphics programming. I taught myself graphics
and shader programming to build [an advanced 2D lighting engine]({% post_url /_posts/2023-08-22-ultalights2d %}) for use in
future projects. For my degree's capstone class, I was heavily involved in the full-stack development of 
[a custom WordPress theme.]({% post_url /_posts/2023-08-22-capstone %})

I'm constantly learning and building new and interesting things.
