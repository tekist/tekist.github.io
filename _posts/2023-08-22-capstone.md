### Overview

For the Spring 2023 web development and digital media capstone class, we were tasked with building a full website which represented the
department. How we went about doing so was entirely up to the class. Ultimately, we decided to build a custom WordPress theme which we could
use to integrate our novel designs and functionality.

### My Role

I took an active role in almost every aspect of the project. I tried to push my skillset as far as I could to the best final result.
Although I spent most of my time deep diving into the diverse WordPress technologies and APIs, I also helped to communicate, coordinate, and make decisions on fundamental aspects of the site. I produced most of the back-end used by the site but also contributed to the front-end. The navigation bar was one of my front-end contributions.

### Conclusion

This project not only gave me experience as a full-stack developer, but also with the challenges of coordinating and working with a diverse team of people, each with their own skillset. 

It's now up to the department and future capstone classes to determine how to host, maintain, and update the site.
