<h1 class="margin-top-1rem">Overview</h1>

For my WEB 238, we were tasked with utilizing [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to build an in-browser app. I decided to build an asynchronous chat system with multiple features you may find in other messenging apps, along with an interface. The current version is exactly the same as the one submitted for the final assignment, only the database has been set to read-only for security purposes.[Check out the codepen here!](https://codepen.io/flawless128/pen/vYraWXZ?editors=1011)

## Features

- Login and account creation system along with user authentication
- Notification system which displays messages that can be dismissed by simply clicking them
- Message and polling system which checks periodically for new messages, and displays new ones without reloading old messages
- Intuitive UI to show whether a user sent a message or not, like many other messaging apps

## Conclusion

Building this system made me understand why encryption is so important. Any message entered into the database can be read directly, hence one of the reasons for setting it to read-only. An end-to-end encrypted messenger might be an interesting future project.
