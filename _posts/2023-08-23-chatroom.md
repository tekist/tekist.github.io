### Overview

For my WEB 238, we were tasked with utilizing [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to build an in-browser app. I decided to build an asynchronous chat system with multiple features you may find in other messenging apps. [Check out the codepen here!](https://codepen.io/flawless128/pen/vYraWXZ?editors=1011)

### Features

- Login and account creation system along with user authentication
- Notification system which displays messages that can be dismissed by simply clicking them
- Message and polling system which checks periodically for new messages, and displays new ones without reloading old messages
- Intuitive UI to show whether a user sent a message or not, like many other messaging apps
